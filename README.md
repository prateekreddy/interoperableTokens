# Token Interoperability

Here we have 2 ERC20 tokens A and B and the interoperability contract provides a way for users of Token A to send Token B to users.

Setup a Ethereum node and for development purposes you can quickly setup using ganache-cli

start ganache cli using `ganache-cli -d -l 99999999999`

You can deploy contracts by going to the root of the repository and then running `truffle deploy`
Then you can run the test by using `node test/test`
